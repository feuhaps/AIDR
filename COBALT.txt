=========== 
Note on compiling: 


Checked out current state from repository and compiled with:
	mvn install -Pdev -DskipTests
	
Prepared project files with
	mvn eclipse:eclipse -Pdev -DskipTests
	
Due to the setup of different module-files in aidr-task-manager and aidr-db-manager, Eclipse shows up Classpath problems, as for the sub-modules, such as aidr-db-manager-ejb, no Eclipse projects are installed.
This can be solved by replacing the "-ejb"-suffix with "-ear" in affected .classpath files.
